So what are tracks? Tracks are like little road lego pieces placed together by a user so other people can drive on it. There are a lot of websites that host these tracks but the most popular ones are [tmnf.exchange](tmnf.exchange) and [tmuf.exchange](tmuf.exchange). [tmnf.exchange](tmnf.exchange) hosts tracks that are made for the free to play version of [TMUF](https://store.steampowered.com/app/7200/Trackmania_United_Forever/) called [Trackmania Nations Forever](https://store.steampowered.com/app/11020/TrackMania_Nations_Forever/) (TMNF) and [tmuf.exchange](tmuf.exchange) hosts tracks that are made for every environment other than stadium mostly (like snow car, island and rally)
