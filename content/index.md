I'm Kusari also known online as Faji. I play the racing game [Trackmania United Forever](https://store.steampowered.com/app/7200/Trackmania_United_Forever/) made by [Nadeo](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/studio/nadeo) and in that game I make lots of [[tracks]] and I also run a [[weeklycomp|weekly competition]] with some of my friends that has a big copper prize (coppers are the in game currency in Trackmania)
